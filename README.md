### 3D Workforce development simulation for historically marginalized communities

# K-Shaped: The Bridge

K-Shaped: The Bridge is a Unity-powered web game that trains Black and Brown workers for high-salary, high-barrier technical roles—starting with **data center technicians**—by providing safe, accessible “technical flight hours” and high-stakes communication practice.

## 🌍 Problem

We are living in a **K-shaped economy**:  
while wealth accelerates upward for some, historically marginalized communities remain locked in the lower arm due to **high barriers to entry** in emerging technical jobs.

For roles like data center technicians:
- You can’t practice on a \$50,000 server at home
- Training equipment is expensive and inaccessible
- Microaggressions and biased workplace dynamics are rarely addressed in technical training

This lack of access directly reinforces the racial wealth gap.

## 💡 Solution

**The Bridge** removes hardware and access barriers by turning any browser into a high-tech training lab.

We built a **3D WebGL simulation** that:
- Replicates real-world data center tasks (cable management, thermal regulation)
- Trains both **technical skills** and **professional communication**
- Allows players to safely practice high-stakes scenarios without real-world risk

If you have a Chromebook, you have access.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

The MVP focuses on two core scenarios commonly faced by data center technicians:

### 🔌 Cable Management
- Power vs data cables
- Proper routing and organization
- Performance and safety implications

### 🌡️ Thermal Regulation
- Overheating servers
- Hot aisle / cold aisle concepts
- Environmental problem-solving under pressure

The simulation intentionally “fakes” complex physics using:
- Triggers
- State changes
- UI overlays  

This keeps the experience accessible, fast, and human-centered.
