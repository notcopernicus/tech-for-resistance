# K-Shaped: 3D Workforce development simulation for historically marginalized communities

K-Shaped is a simulation game that trains Black and Brown workers for high-salary, high-barrier technical roles—starting with **data center technicians**—by providing safe, accessible technical training and high-stakes communication practice.

---

### Problem

We are living in a **K-shaped economy**:  
while wealth accelerates upward for some, historically marginalized communities remain locked in the lower arm due to **high barriers to entry** in emerging technical jobs.

### Solution

We built an acessible **simulation** that:

- Replicates real-world data center tasks (cable management, thermal regulation)
- Trains both **technical skills** and **professional communication**
- Allows players to safely practice high-stakes scenarios without real-world risk

- **Target Careers:**  
  - IT Support  
  - Data Center Operations  
  - Cloud Infrastructure  
  - Medical / Automotive / Aerospace technical roles

### Tech Stack
- **Unity** (C#)
- **Unity WebGL**
- **JSON** 
- **GitHub**
- **Typescript**

Future iterations:
- AI-assisted coaching (OpenAI integration)
- Figma (UX/UI design)
- Backend session logging & analytics
- Extensive training regime


### System Design 
- **Access over realism**: playable scence with models > perfect physics
- **Modular architecture** for sustainability
