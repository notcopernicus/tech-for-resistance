# K-Shaped: 3D Workforce development simulation for historically marginalized communities

K-Shaped: The Bridge is a Unity-powered web game that trains Black and Brown workers for high-salary, high-barrier technical roles—starting with **data center technicians**—by providing safe, accessible “technical flight hours” and high-stakes communication practice.

## Problem

We are living in a **K-shaped economy**:  
while wealth accelerates upward for some, historically marginalized communities remain locked in the lower arm due to **high barriers to entry** in emerging technical jobs.

For roles like data center technicians:
- You can’t practice on a \$50,000 server at home
- Training equipment is expensive and inaccessible
- Microaggressions and biased workplace dynamics are rarely addressed in technical training

This lack of access directly reinforces the racial wealth gap.

## Solution

We built a **3D WebGL simulation** that:

- Replicates real-world data center tasks (cable management, thermal regulation)
- Trains both **technical skills** and **professional communication**
- Allows players to safely practice high-stakes scenarios without real-world risk

If you have a Chromebook, you have access.

## Gameplay Overview

The MVP focuses on two core scenarios commonly faced by data center technicians:

### Cable Management
- Power vs data cables
- Proper routing and organization
- Performance and safety implications

### Thermal Regulation
- Overheating servers
- Hot aisle / cold aisle concepts
- Environmental problem-solving under pressure

The simulation intentionally “fakes” complex physics using:
- Triggers
- State changes
- UI overlays  

This keeps the experience accessible, fast, and human-centered.

## Target Audience

- **End Users:** Black & Brown workers  

- **Model:** B2B2C (workforce programs, training partners)

- **Target Careers:**  
  - IT Support  
  - Data Center Operations  
  - Cloud Infrastructure  
  - Medical / Automotive / Aerospace technical roles

## Tech Stack

- **Unity** (C#)
- **Unity WebGL**
- **JSON** (
- **GitHub**
- **Typescript**

Future iterations:
- AI-assisted coaching (OpenAI integration)
- Figma (UX/UI design)
- Backend session logging & analytics


## System Design 

- **Access over realism**: playable > perfect physics
- **Modular architecture** for sustainability
- **Human-centered design** over technical intimidation
- **Equity-first workforce development**
